 * @mainpage Robin Development API
 *
 * Robin's API is indended for use by sophisticated programmers who wish
 * to extend the capabilities of Robin or to embed Robin within a C++
 * application, exploiting Robin's enhanced reflection capabilities.
 *
 * A special case is when one is manually coding an extension module for
 * Python and wish to integrate it with existing C++ code previously wrapped
 * using Robin and running through Robin's Python front-end. If you meet that
 * criteria, skip immediately to the API for Robin::Python::Facade, which
 * contains the ultimate primitives for such a use case.
